    "text": "Why R & python\nI believe its important both to use the tools that best suit your interests and skills. However; I also believe it is important to be aware of what other avenues might exist. This workflow takes advantage of an environmental data distribution tool known as ERDDAP. This framework has API’s that interface with both python & R and I wanted to highlight how similar these interfaces R for researchers who might be looking for an example to show the paralells across the two languages.\n\nAccessing SST ovia ERDDAP\nIn this demo we will be using a data product made available by NOAA known as Optimally Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature or OISST. This resource contains global sea surface temperatures dating back to September of 1981.\n\nERDDAP Access Tools\nThe two main steps to accessing SST data, and other resources on ERDDAP are: 1. Locating the ERDDAP server and data resource 2. Using an api tool like rerddap or erdappy to generate URL’s for ERDDAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA work by Adam A.
